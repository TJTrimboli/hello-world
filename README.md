Forgot to complete the tutorial

Travis here, I work in InfoSec for a local cyber company. Focus is on sales development right now, but have an increasing interest in more traditional IT and security roles. Through formal education, certifications, and self-study my goal is to change my career path away from sales.

Always interested in learning about new tools, expanding my coding knowledge, and expanding my technical abilities in general. While still a n00b, I am making my way slowly but surely.
